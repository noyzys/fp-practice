# FP CONCEPTS 

# 1. FUNCTOR:
* A Functor is a datatype that preserves structure and implements the map function.
* Preserving structure simply means that you can put a value inside and the structure itself wonâ€™t change it.
* Map (or mapper/fmap) is a function that takes a function as an argument and applies that function to the values in the structure it operates on.

#2. MONAD:
* A monad is a structure that combines program fragments (functions), and wraps their return values in a type with additional computation.
* Example from java java.util.Optional - Monad

#3. MONOIDS:
A Monoid is a design pattern expressing function composition of items in a set, 
is a function that takes two arguments and returns an argument of that type and it supports both the identity property.

**Pure functions ;]**
# IN KOTLIN:
A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result. 
In Kotlin, We can define higher-order functions using lambda expressions. `( (A, B) -> C )`.
Example from kotlin functor `fold`.
A pure function doesn't depend on anything other than its input parameters.
